# PHP groupwork project


1. **Identifying dolphins**
    * Purpose of the project is to get to know which dolphin did you see. For an example if you are standing by a pool with three dolphins in it, it might be hard to identify which one did you saw jumping out of the water or constantly swimmig up to you. For identifying you can enter the dolphins features such as color or fin shape and the app will tell you which dolphin did you see. Also you can have your own personal user in there so you can recod your history in there. This can help to observe dolphins behavior. 
    * This app can be helpful to people working with dolphins. I'm going to make this app specifically about an organisation DRC (Dolphin Research Center) where I have been myself as a voulenteer worker. Most of the workers there know the dolphins by heart but it can be really helpful for the beginners or for the visitors. I found an app where a student also made this kind of an app. He made it to identify individual dolphins in order to study their behavioral and ecological patterns. This app compared to mine comapres dolphins with pictures of dorsal fins.
